        My name is Chris Mikstas and I am currently a sales professional with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing.
        I have spent the last three years focused on selling wireless products to state, local, and federal
        government entities. As I have worked with these government entities, I have made many acquaintances with IT workgroups
        that do web development and it has inspired me to learn these skills as well.
